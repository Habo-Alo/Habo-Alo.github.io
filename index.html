             <h1>My Story with Web Development</h1>
    <span>
  When I was in high school, I always wanted to be a teacher.
  When I started to go to college, I started to use computers and the internet more in my daily life.
  Then, I wanted to learn how computers, softwares, and web pages work.
  That is what motivated me to study computer information systems in college, and start looking for a source that teaches me how to code.
  I figured out that I enjoy doing hands- on projects and learning while applying my learning rather than just keep reading and watching videos.

        With Refcode, I will learn how to build my first website, and know how to code, which for me is the most valuable experience that I will gain.
